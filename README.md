## Problem & Users
Heat stress poses a significant human and financial burden in the United States, contributing to hundreds of worker deaths and over **$1 billion in annual medical costs**. Current safety practices are largely **reactive and compliance-driven**, relying on generic checklists and weather alerts without incorporating **real-time health monitoring**. This leaves workers vulnerable to heat exhaustion and stroke while also creating major inefficiencies for employers.  

For example, unmanaged heat stress leads to **productivity losses in the construction industry ranging from 29% to 41%**, highlighting the urgent need for a preventative, data-driven solution.

## Model / Approach
Aegis integrates **physiological and environmental data** to deliver predictive insights into worker heat risk.  

- **Datasets:** Public IEEE dataset on thermal comfort (age, gender, body temperature, HRV) + real-time weather APIs (humidity, heat index, air quality).  
- **Guidelines:** Thresholds based on **OSHA heat safety standards**.  
- **Wearable Integration:** A smart device collects biodata, generating individualized **Heat Risk Scores**.  
- **Alerts:**  
  - **Yellow Alert** → Caution, worker advised to slow down.  
  - **Red Alert** → Immediate stop, hydration required.  
- **Dashboard:** Aggregates data for compliance reporting, shift scheduling, and liability reduction.  

This combined approach ensures proactive interventions, preventing heat exhaustion and stroke before they occur.

## Deployment Plan
- **Backend:** Hosted on AWS EC2, running a Flask web server with Python 3.  
- **Frontend:** Deployed via Vercel, built with **Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript**.  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Random Forest (XGBoost), optimized for accuracy in predicting individual worker safety risks.  

---

## Impact Metrics
- **Productivity Boost:** Downtime hours prevented through proactive risk alerts.  
- **Reduced Costs:** Fewer workers’ compensation claims and insurance payouts.  
- **Lives Saved:** Predicted fatalities and emergency department visits averted.

## Data Governance
Aegis is built with **privacy, fairness, and compliance** at its core:  

- **De-Identification:** All worker data anonymized before analysis.  
- **PHI Handling:** HIPAA-aligned encryption, access controls, and retention policies.  
- **Licenses/ToS:** Strict adherence to partner data terms and usage rights.  
- **Model Card:** Transparent documentation of model purpose, assumptions, and limitations.  
- **Fairness Audits:** Regular bias checks across age, gender, and health baselines to ensure equity.  
- **Governance Reviews:** Periodic oversight to maintain privacy, legal compliance, and trust.
