## **⚡ Immediate Next Steps**

### **For Development Team Leaders:**

1. **[REQUIRED] Read Master Todo File:**
   ```bash
   # Open the central coordination document
   open HEATGUARD_MASTER_TODO.md

   # Current Status: Integration & Testing Phase
   # Timeline: 3-day sprint to demo readiness
   # Foundation: Excellent (backend production-ready, frontend 70% complete)
   ```

2. **[REQUIRED] Spawn Primary Subagents:**
   ```bash
   # In Claude Code, create these three specialists:

   /agents create
   Name: heatguard-frontend-integration-specialist
   # Use system prompt from HEATGUARD_SUBAGENT_PROTOCOLS.md

   /agents create
   Name: heatguard-fullstack-integration-specialist
   # Use system prompt from HEATGUARD_SUBAGENT_PROTOCOLS.md

   /agents create
   Name: heatguard-demo-specialist
   # Use system prompt from HEATGUARD_SUBAGENT_PROTOCOLS.md
   ```

3. **[CRITICAL] Start Frontend-Backend Integration:**
   ```bash
   # Priority 1: Get dashboard showing live data
   # Focus: /src/lib/api-client.ts and /src/hooks/use-thermal-comfort.ts
   # Test: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health with demo key
   ```

## **⚠️ Emergency Contacts**

### **If Critical Issues Arise:**

1. **Safety-Critical System Failure (Code Red):**
   - Spawn `emergency-safety-recovery-specialist` immediately
   - Follow HEATGUARD_EMERGENCY_PROTOCOLS.md → Code Red section
   - Priority: Restore safety monitoring within 30 minutes

2. **Demo-Blocking Issues (Code Orange):**
   - Spawn `emergency-integration-specialist`
   - Activate backup demo strategies from emergency protocols
   - Focus on minimal viable demo within remaining time

3. **Performance Issues (Code Yellow):**
   - Check API response times and dashboard performance
   - Use specialized subagents from spawning protocols as needed

3. **Safety intervention** - Demonstrate alerts and OSHA recommendations
4. **Impact measurement** - Show compliance logging and ROI data

### **Technical Differentiation (2 minutes):**
- **XGBoost ML accuracy:** 90%+ prediction accuracy vs simple temperature alerts
- **Production architecture:** FastAPI + React, ready to scale to 10,000+ workers
- **Regulatory compliance:** Built-in OSHA logging saves customers legal/audit costs

### **Market Closing (1 minute):**
"Every construction, delivery, farming, and landscaping company needs this. We prevent injuries, reduce costs, and boost productivity 20%. The technology is proven, the market is massive, and the problem is urgent."
