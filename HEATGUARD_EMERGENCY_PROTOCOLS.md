# **HeatGuard Pro - Emergency Coordination Protocols**
## **Safety-Critical Emergency Response Framework**

---

## **⚠️ SAFETY-CRITICAL CONTEXT**

HeatGuard Pro is a **life-safety system** preventing heat stroke and workplace injuries. Emergency protocols must account for:

- **Life Safety Impact:** System failures could lead to missed heat emergencies
- **Regulatory Compliance:** OSHA requirements for worker safety monitoring
- **Real-Time Requirements:** Prediction delays >1 minute could miss critical interventions
- **Demo Stakes:** System must demonstrate reliability for investor/customer confidence

---

## **🚨 Emergency Classification System**

### **Code Red - System Failure (Life Safety Impact)**
**Criteria:**
- Safety alert system completely non-functional
- ML prediction model returning invalid/dangerous results (false negatives)
- API down for >15 minutes during operational hours
- Dashboard showing incorrect risk levels or missing critical workers

**Response Time:** **IMMEDIATE (<5 minutes)**

**Emergency Team Assembly:**
```bash
# IMMEDIATE RESPONSE PROTOCOL
1. Spawn emergency-safety-specialist (full tool access)
2. Alert all active subagents to code red status
3. Activate backup safety monitoring systems
4. Implement manual safety override procedures

# Emergency Specialist System Prompt:
"CODE RED SAFETY EMERGENCY: HeatGuard Pro safety-critical failure detected.
Your mission: Restore safety monitoring capability within 30 minutes using any means necessary.
Lives depend on accurate heat risk predictions. Implement manual override, backup systems,
or emergency fall-back procedures immediately."
```

### **Code Orange - Demo Blocking Issues**
**Criteria:**
- Frontend-backend integration completely broken <24hrs before demo
- No real-time data flow to dashboard
- Critical components crashing during demo preparation
- Performance degradation making system unusable

**Response Time:** **URGENT (<30 minutes)**

### **Code Yellow - Performance/UX Issues**
**Criteria:**
- API response times >2 seconds consistently
- Dashboard loading >10 seconds
- Minor safety alert delays (but still functional)
- Non-critical feature failures

**Response Time:** **HIGH PRIORITY (<2 hours)**

## **🔥 Emergency Response Procedures**

### **Code Red Protocol: Safety System Failure**

#### **Phase 1: Immediate Containment (0-5 minutes)**
```markdown
## EMERGENCY COORDINATOR ACTIONS:

1. **STOP ALL NON-CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT**
   - All subagents immediately focus on safety restoration
   - Suspend feature development and demo polish
   - Redirect all resources to critical path

2. **IMPLEMENT EMERGENCY BACKUP**
   - Activate manual worker monitoring procedures
   - Deploy simplified prediction model if primary fails
   - Use static risk thresholds as backup safety system

3. **NOTIFY ALL STAKEHOLDERS**
   - Update master todo with 🚨 SAFETY EMERGENCY status
   - Coordinate immediate response across all subagents
   - Document timeline and actions for post-incident review

4. **SPAWN EMERGENCY SPECIALISTS**
   ```bash
   # Emergency Safety Specialist
   Name: emergency-safety-recovery-specialist
   Priority: MAXIMUM
   Tools: ALL available tools
   Mission: Restore safety monitoring within 30 minutes
   Authority: Override all development practices for safety

   # Emergency Integration Specialist
   Name: emergency-integration-specialist
   Priority: MAXIMUM
   Mission: Minimal viable safety system if full restore impossible
   ```
```

#### **Phase 2: Safety Restoration (5-30 minutes)**
```markdown
## EMERGENCY RESTORATION PRIORITIES:

### Priority 1: Basic Prediction Capability
- [ ] ML model responding to prediction requests
- [ ] API endpoints returning risk scores (even if simplified)
- [ ] Basic threshold alerts working (>0.75 = danger)

### Priority 2: Critical Alert Path
- [ ] High-risk predictions triggering dashboard alerts
- [ ] Audio/visual notifications for supervisors
- [ ] Emergency contact procedures functional

### Priority 3: Minimal Dashboard Function
- [ ] Worker status visible (even with basic data)
- [ ] Risk levels clearly indicated (green/yellow/red)
- [ ] Alert notifications reaching supervisors

### Fallback Options (if restoration impossible):
- **Static Risk Monitoring:** Use temperature/humidity thresholds only
- **Manual Supervisor Alerts:** SMS/email notifications for high temperatures
- **Simplified Dashboard:** Show basic environmental data with manual risk assessment
```

#### **Phase 3: Validation & Monitoring (30-60 minutes)**
```markdown
## SAFETY SYSTEM VALIDATION:

### Critical Tests (ALL must pass):
- [ ] **False Negative Test:** System detects high-risk scenarios (>0.8 risk score)
- [ ] **Alert Latency Test:** Danger alerts reach supervisors within 60 seconds
- [ ] **Dashboard Reliability:** Worker status updates consistently
- [ ] **API Stability:** No crashes during continuous operation

### Continuous Monitoring:
- [ ] API health checks every 30 seconds
- [ ] Dashboard functionality verified every 5 minutes
- [ ] Alert system tested with simulated emergencies
- [ ] All subagents report status every 15 minutes

### Success Criteria for Code Red Resolution:
- [ ] Safety predictions accurate within 95% confidence
- [ ] Alert system 100% functional
- [ ] Dashboard stable for 30+ minutes continuous operation
- [ ] No false negatives in safety testing
```

### **Code Orange Protocol: Demo Emergency**

#### **Immediate Actions (0-30 minutes)**
```markdown
1. **ASSESS DEMO VIABILITY**
   - Can we achieve minimal working demo in remaining time?
   - What features can be sacrificed to save core functionality?
   - Do we need backup demo strategy?

2. **PRIORITIZE DEMO CRITICAL PATH**
   - Safety alerts working (most important for story)
   - Basic prediction display (shows ML capability)
   - Smooth scenario transition (professional presentation)

3. **ACTIVATE BACKUP PLANS**
   - Prepare static demo with pre-recorded data
   - Create slide deck explaining full technical capabilities
   - Focus narrative on production-ready architecture
```

#### **Demo Emergency Decision Tree**
```mermaid

    A[Demo Emergency Detected] --> B{Can fix in <4 hours?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Emergency Integration Sprint]
    B -->|No| D[Activate Backup Demo]

    C --> E{Integration successful?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Continue with Live Demo]

    G --> I[Live API + Pre-recorded Frontend]
    H --> J[Focus on Technical Architecture]
    I --> J
    F --> K[Full Live Demo]
```

#### **Backup Demo Strategies**

**Option 1: API-Only Demo**
```markdown
- Demonstrate ML model accuracy with Postman/curl
- Show prediction API returning realistic risk scores
- Display backend architecture and performance metrics
- Explain frontend integration as "next sprint"
- Emphasize production-ready backend infrastructure
```

**Option 2: Frontend-Only Demo**
```markdown
- Use mock data for realistic worker scenarios
- Show polished dashboard with simulated real-time updates
- Demonstrate safety alert system with staged scenarios
- Focus on user experience and supervisor workflow
- Explain backend integration as "technical implementation detail"
```

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
```markdown
- Live backend API demonstrating ML predictions
- Pre-recorded frontend showing dashboard capabilities
- Manual coordination between API calls and dashboard
- Presenter explains: "In production, this is automated"
- Emphasizes both technical depth and user experience
```
