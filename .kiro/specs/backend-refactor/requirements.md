# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves a comprehensive refactoring of the existing thermal comfort prediction backend system. The current implementation has multiple Flask applications, redundant files, and complex API endpoints. The goal is to streamline the backend to use FastAPI with a single, focused endpoint that queries the thermal comfort model and returns a risk score.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and simplified backend architecture, so that the codebase is maintainable and focused on core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the backend SHALL contain only essential files for the thermal comfort prediction service
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or redundant files
3. WHEN reviewing the architecture THEN the system SHALL use FastAPI instead of Flask
4. IF a file does not contribute to the core prediction functionality THEN it SHALL be removed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client application, I want a single prediction endpoint, so that I can query the thermal comfort model with input features and receive a risk score.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making a POST request to the prediction endpoint THEN the system SHALL accept thermal comfort features as input
2. WHEN the model processes the input THEN the system SHALL return a risk score between 0 and 1
3. WHEN the prediction is successful THEN the response SHALL include the risk score and confidence level
4. IF the input features are invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN the endpoint is called THEN it SHALL use the existing trained XGBoost model and preprocessing components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to use FastAPI, so that I benefit from modern Python web framework features like automatic API documentation and better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL use FastAPI as the web framework
2. WHEN accessing the API documentation THEN FastAPI SHALL automatically generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
3. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL use FastAPI's automatic request/response validation
4. WHEN the server runs THEN it SHALL maintain the same core prediction functionality as the original Flask implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve the existing model artifacts and prediction logic, so that the refactored system maintains the same prediction accuracy and behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL continue to use the existing XGBoost model files
2. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL use the same feature preprocessing and scaling logic
3. WHEN calculating risk scores THEN the system SHALL maintain the conservative bias approach from the original implementation
4. WHEN the model loads THEN it SHALL use the same model artifacts (scaler, label encoder, feature columns) as the original system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a client application, I want clear error handling and response formats, so that I can properly handle both successful predictions and error cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model fails to load THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
2. WHEN input validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error messages indicating which features are missing or invalid
3. WHEN a prediction succeeds THEN the response SHALL follow a consistent JSON format
4. WHEN an internal error occurs THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
